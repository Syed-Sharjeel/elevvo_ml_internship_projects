# Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details such as income, credit score, and property area. It supports faster and more reliable decision-making for applicants and financial institutions.

---

## Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical features).
- Performed feature analysis with correlation matrix.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Used MSE and Confusion Matrix for evaluation.
---
## Results
- **XGBoost** consistently performed best with the lowest MSE.
- SMOTE improved class balance and overall accuracy.
- Models were checked against overfitting/underfitting.
---
## Conclusion
XGBoost proved to be the most effective model for predicting loan approvals, both with imbalanced and balanced datasets.
