# Student Score Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts **student exam scores** using study-related features.  
Includes **data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** with multiple regression techniques.

---

## Highlights
- Data preprocessing & feature importance analysis  
- Visualizations: Correlation matrix, histograms  
- Models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Evaluation with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- Checked for **overfitting** using Train/Test MSE
