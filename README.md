## Projects

### 1. Student Score Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict student exam scores based on study-related features.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Started with **Simple Linear Regression**.  
  - Explored multiple ML models to reduce bias and improve prediction accuracy.  
- **Skills Highlighted:** Regression models, feature engineering, performance evaluation.  
- **Use Case:** Helps identify students at risk and support personalized study plans.

### 2. Loan Approval Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant data.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Applied classification algorithms with proper preprocessing.  
  - Compared models to ensure fair, unbiased predictions.  
- **Skills Highlighted:** Classification models, handling imbalanced data, evaluation metrics.  
- **Use Case:** Can be used by banks/financial institutions to automate loan approval decisions.

### 3. Traffic Sign Recognition
- **Objective:** Train a deep learning model to recognize traffic signs from images.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Used **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **TensorFlow**.  
  - Trained on thousands of traffic sign images to identify shapes, colors, and patterns.  
  - Achieved **~99% accuracy** on test data.  
- **Industrial Impact:**  
  - Could support **self-driving cars**, **driver-assistance systems**, and **smart road monitoring**.  
- **Skills Highlighted:** Deep learning, image classification, CNNs, TensorFlow.
