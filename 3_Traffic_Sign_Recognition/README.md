# Traffic Sign Recognition

## Project Overview
This project trains a deep learning model to recognize different traffic signs from images, similar to how drivers interpret them on the road. The system learns unique shapes, colors, and patterns, enabling it to accurately classify new signs such as stop, speed limit, or pedestrian crossing.

## Industrial Use
This system can be applied in:
- Self-driving cars  
- Driver assistance tools  
- Smart road monitoring systems 
---

## Key Steps
- Preprocessed dataset into images (data) and labels.
- Built and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with dropout and batch normalization layers.
- Compiled with Adam optimizer and evaluated using accuracy metrics and visualizations.

---

## Results
- Achieved **~99% accuracy** on test data.
- Reliable classification of traffic signs, with minimal errors.
